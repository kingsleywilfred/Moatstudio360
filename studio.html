	<p>Studio 360 is an American weekly public radio program about the arts and culture hosted by novelist Kurt Andersen and produced by Public Radio International (PRI) and Slate in New York City. The program's stated goal is to "Get inside the creative mind" and uses arts and culture as a lens to understand our world. The program was created by PRI based on an identified need for programming dedicated and focused on arts and culture journalism in media.
